# EduX

As a result of current unstable situation of politics and economy, Sri Lanka's education sector is 
experiencing significant issues.
Many colleges and institutions struggle to provide basic services and facilities to the students 
due to lack of funding. As a result, education has declined in quality, and many pupils are 
finding it difficult to keep up with their studies. So, to overcome this problem, our developing 
team has come up with the idea of an app called “EduX” to help the students in our country.
With the help of various innovative tools, the "EduX" app provides students with all the 
educational support they need to advance their knowledge. This mobile application involves 
three principal parties. They are students, teachers, and donors. Students can enroll for courses 
and quizzes. The service that the teachers are offering is free, but if any donors would like to 
contribute money for it, they can do so through this app. Donating money isn’t compulsory 
here. Donors who want to give books for the benefit of students can do so through this 
approach. Users now have the option to create and publish blog posts directly from their 
mobile device. We have made it easy for users to write and design their blog entries, including 
photographs and videos, and to preview their work before publishing.
